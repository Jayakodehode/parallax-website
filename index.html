      <h2>what is holi</h2>
      <p>
        Holi also known as the Festival of Colours, Festival of Spring, and
        Festival of Love, is one of the most popular and significant festivals
        in Hinduism. It celebrates the eternal and divine love of god Radha and
        Krishna. The day also signifies the triumph of good over evil, as it
        commemorates the victory of god Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over
        Hiranyakashipu. It originated and is predominantly celebrated in the
        Indian subcontinent but has also spread to other regions of Asia and
        parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora

      <p>
        Holi celebrates the arrival of Spring (season) in India, the end of
        winter, and the blossoming of love, and for many, it is a festive day to
        meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken
        relationships. The festival is also an invocation for a good spring
        harvest season. It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening
        of the Purnima (Full Moon Day) falling in the Hindu calendar month of
        Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian
        calendar. The first evening is known as "Holika Dahan" or "Chhoti Holi"
        and the following day as "Holi", "Rangwali Holi", "Dol Purnima",
        "Dhuleti", "Dhulandi", "Ukuli", "Manjal Kuli", "Yaosang", "Shigmo",
        "Phagwah",or "Jajiri"

      <h2>How we wll celebrate holi</h2>
      <p>
        Holi celebrations start on the night before Holi with the ritual of
        Holika Dahan where people gather and perform religious rituals in front
        of a bonfire and pray that their internal evils be destroyed the way
        Holika, the sister of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, was killed in the
        fire. The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi (Dhuleti) where
        people smear and drench each other with colours. Water guns and
        water-filled balloons are often used to play and colour each other, with
        anyone and any place being considered fair game to color. Groups often
        carry drums and other musical instruments going from place to place
        singing and dancing. Throughout the day people visit family, and friends
        and foes come together to chat, enjoy food and drink, and partake in
        Holi delicacies.
